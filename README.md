# Welcome to my MATH101 Notebook!
This notebook is a collection of notes on the Excursions in Modern Mathematics by Tannenbaum, 9th Edition.
Get started by clicking on the [table of contents](Table_of_Contents.md).

## The Goal
I want this notebook to be easily accessible and work similarly to Wikipedia. Also, this is allowing me to learn how to use Obsidian as well as GitHub which I hope to use later on.

## How am I Making This?
All of these files are currently being made in [Obsidain](https://obsidian.md/) and are then uploaded to GitHub and formatted a little bit.
In May I plan on uploading the raw Obsidian files in case people are curious about how I format everything.
