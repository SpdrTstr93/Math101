# Welcome to my MATH101 Notebook!
This notebook is a collection of notes on the Excursions in Modern Mathematics by Tannenbaum, 9th Edition.

## The Goal
I want this notebook to be easily accessible and work similarly to Wikipedia.

## How am I Making This?
All of these files are currently being made in [Obsidain](https://obsidian.md/) and are best viewed in that program.
But I am going to be working on these documents in the mean time to convert them to Githubs interpretation of markdown.
