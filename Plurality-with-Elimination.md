This is used in the case when none of the candidates have the majority number of votes. A number of rounds are held until there is a candidate that has the majority number of votes. The same table can be used with elimination to observer what happens with elimination.

- **Round 1**: The candidate with the least amount of first place votes is eliminated from the running. In this case B is eliminated. Now candidate D gains four votes.

| Number of voters | 14 | 10 | 8 | 4 | 1|

| 1st | A | C | D | D | C |
| 2nd | C | D | C | C | D |
| 3rd | D | A | A | A | A |

- **Round 2**: Now check to see if any of the candidates have the majority amount of votes. If none do, eliminate the next candidate with the least amount of votes. Candidate C is eliminated and candidate D gains 11 votes. ==D Wins!==

Real life examples of this method are known as **Instant-Runoff** or **Ranked-Choice**. Typically these have a truncated ballot of just three candidates. There is a possibility that after a couple round of elimination that some ballots my no longer have running candidates. These votes are called **exhausted votes** and are no longer counted in the election.
