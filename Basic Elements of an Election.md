- **The candidates**: Also know as alternatives, these are the things that you are voting for. 
- **The voters**: These are the people that get a say in the outcome of an election. In most democratic elections all voters are assumed to have equal say.
- **The ballots**: How the voter expresses their opinion on the candidates. This can take the form of a paper ballot or electronic.
	- **Single-choice**: Fill in your top pick and nothing else
	- **Preference**: Rank all the candidates from best to worst. These can be individual or collected into a **preference schedule** where you count all the voters that have the same ranking and make a summary table.
	- **Truncated preference**: Used in elections with a large amount of candidates where the voter will rank some of the candidates and not others.
