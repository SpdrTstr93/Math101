One of the simplest and a very common election method for determining the outcome of an election. All that matters is ==who is ranked first== in a preference schedule and how many votes they have. This system doesn't need a preference schedule and can simply be decided by single choice. 

>[!example] Using a preference schedule
>In this case, A is the winner because they had the most first choice votes.
>
> | Number of voters | 14 | 10 | 8 | 4 | 1|
> | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
> | 1st | A | C | D | B | C |
> | 2nd | B | B | C | D | D |
> | 3rd | C | D | B | C | B |
> | 4th | D | A | A | A | A |

- **Issues**: Sometimes the winner does not have the majority of the votes. A good way to know if a candidate is a good one is to determine if there is a [[Fairness Criteria and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem|Condorcet candidate]].
