In mathematics the use of subsets and permutations are very useful when looking at coalitions and even sequential coalitions.

## Subsets
This is going to look very similar to what was covered in [[Banzhaf Power]] when creating coalitions but now, using mathematics, we can make sure we have selected looked at all the subsets
>[!info] Number of Subsets
>A set with *N* elements has $2^N$ subsets.

>[!info] Number of Coalitions
>A [[Weighted Voting|weighted voting system]] with *N* players has $2^N-1$ coalitions

>[!info] Number of Coalitions of Two or More Players
>A [[Weighted Voting|weighted voting system]] with *N* players has $2^N-N-1$ coalitions of two or more players

## Permutations and Sequential Coalitions
- **Permutation**: A set of objects in a order is a *permutation*. A different order of objects is a different *permutation*.
>[!note] Number of Permutations/Sequential Coalitions
>There are *N*! different permutations of *N* objects$(N!=1*2*...*N)$

>[!note] Number of Sequential Coalitions With P in the kTH Position
>Say you want to know how many times a certain player is in the second position. Use the equation $(N-1)!$ to find out!
